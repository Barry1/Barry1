## Deb822 source-Files

RepoLib and Apt-Manage is intended to operate strictly with DEB822-style sources. Some software may automatically add or modify existing one-line sources within your system configuration. Because of this, Apt-Manage includes a conversion utility to automatically generate DEB822 sources from any active one-line sources in your system configuration.

`apt-manage`
