# My first try for more details within my profile

I'm just starting getting to know more and more around github.  
This is so great. I really love :star_struck: the markdown language for publishing information.

## Small project

I try to build a python package called `valuefragments`.  
For that I tried [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/barry1/pyvaluefragments/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/barry1/pyvaluefragments).  
For live playing around with my first steps, you might try
[![Binder JupyterNotebook](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Barry1/PyValueFragments/HEAD "JupyterNotebook")
[![Binder JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Barry1/PyValueFragments/HEAD?urlpath=lab  "JupyterLab")
[![Binder NTERACT](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Barry1/PyValueFragments/HEAD?urlpath=nteract  "nteract")
.
